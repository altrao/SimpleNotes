# Security and Scalability Approach

## Security Measures

The application implements security strategy with multiple layers of protection:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with access and refresh tokens
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Secure password storage hashing

### API Protection
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (visible in [RateLimitConfiguration](src/main/kotlin/com/simplenotes/configuration/RateLimitConfiguration.kt))
- Input validation for all API requests

## Scalability Strategy

### Database Indexing (PostgreSQL)
The indexing strategy focuses on the most critical query paths:

1. **Primary Keys**: All tables have proper primary keys with automatic indexing
2. **Foreign Keys**: Indexed to optimize join operations
3. **Query Patterns**:
    - Composite indexes for common filter combinations
    - Partial indexes for frequently queried subsets of data

### Architectural Scalability
- Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- Pagination implemented for all list endpoints
- Rate limiting prevents system overload
- Asynchronous processing for background tasks

### Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Monitoring in place to identify bottlenecks
